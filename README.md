# Custom Homepage
A cool homepage made with HTML that you can easily customise.

# Instructions


First of all, lets change the homepage to match YOU!
Download the repository, unzip it, and open the file titled customHomepage in Notepad (on Windows), TextEdit (On macOS), Leafpad (On Linux), or any other text or code editor you use. 

To change the name, edit the (YOUR NAME HERE) blocks into your name.
To change the background, download a .jpg picture, and call it background.jpg.

And there's your custom homepage! I might add more features to it, so stay tuned!
