# Custom Homepage
A cool homepage made with HTML that you can easily customise.

# Instructions


First of all, lets change the homepage to match YOU!
Download the repository, unzip it, and open the file titled customHomepage.html in Notepad (on Windows), TextEdit (On macOS), Leafpad (On Linux), or any other text or code editor you use. 

To change the name, change the **(YOUR NAME HERE)** blocks into your name.

To change the background, download a .jpg picture, and call it background.jpg.

To edit the font, grab a .woff font, and rename it font.woff. If you like a .tff font, download it, go to https://andrewsun.com/tools/woffer-woff-font-converter/, click **Choose Files...**, choose your .tff file, and download the .woff file when the converter is done, rename that .woff file to font.woff, move it into the customHomepage folder, and **BOOM!!** Your custom font is now on your homepage!

And there's your custom homepage! I might add more features to it, so stay tuned!
